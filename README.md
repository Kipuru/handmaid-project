If you are seeing this, please know:

This was a project made in THREE DAYS, by a guy with CLOSE TO NO EXPERIENCE. Please DO NOT follow the practices seen in this project (LIKE HAVING MULTIPLE CSS FILES AND ZERO OPTIMIZATION).
I hope to eventually improve my skills when it comes to HTML and CSS. But to get to the great, we must first go through the ugly.

And this, unfortunately, is the ugly.
