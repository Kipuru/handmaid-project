            The <strong>Marthas</strong> wear <strong>green</strong>, and unlike most of the other colours present in <em>The Handmaid's Tale,</em> 
            their colour represents soothing and pleasant aspects of life. Though infertile, they act as caretakers for the children 
            born by the Handmaids.
