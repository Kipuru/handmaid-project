                The <strong>Marthas</strong> wear <strong>green</strong>, and unlike most of the other colours present in <em>The Handmaid's Tale,</em> 
                their colour represents soothing and pleasant aspects of life. Though infertile, they act as caretakers for the children 
                born by the Handmaids, a role that no other citizens of Gilead are allowed to fill. Of course, the <strong>Marthas</strong>
                do not live good lives, as they are still trapped like everyone else. However, their roles as the caretakers of young life 
                may provide a fulfillment that few other women can bask in, and they avoid the terrible fates that others suffer.
