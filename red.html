        <p1 class="text"><strong>Red</strong> is the colour of the <strong>Handmaids.</strong> It represents their roles as "walking wombs" meant to give birth for Gilead. No other women are allowed to become pregnant and give birth, but this is not a luxery to the Handmaids. They are objects to the Republic, stripped of their previously constitutional freedoms, and their value is no more than a factory machine: replaceable, mass-produced. <em>**probably add more here**</em></p1>
