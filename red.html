        <p class="text"><strong>Red</strong> is the colour of the <strong>Handmaids.</strong> It represents their roles as "walking wombs" meant to give birth for Gilead. No other women are allowed to become pregnant and give birth, but that is not a luxery for the Handmaids. They are objects to the Republic, stripped of their previously constitutional freedoms, and their value is of no more than factory machines: <em>replaceable and unnoticeable.</em></p>
        <p class="text">What is noticeable is that <strong>red</strong> is often associated with life and love. However, the <strong>Handmaids</strong> possess no life nor love. They are husks trapped in a society that makes death an appealing escape.</p>
