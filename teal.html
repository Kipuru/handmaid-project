            <strong>Teal</strong> is the colour worn by the <strong>Wives.</strong> It represents their subservice to the Commanders. Though they are "married" to the Comanders, 
            there is none of the love seen in traditional marriges. It seems as though they only hold the title for the sake of avoiding the fate of those like the Handmaids or
            Marthas. The <strong>Teal</strong> is a soothing colour, but it is also one that represents melancholy. The <strong>Wives,</strong> though they avoid terrible lives,
            still feel trapped in the grip of Gilead.
